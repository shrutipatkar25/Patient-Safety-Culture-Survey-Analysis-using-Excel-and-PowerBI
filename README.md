# Patient-Safety-Culture-Survey-Analysis-using-Excel-and-PowerBI
This project talks about how to conduct 'Patient Safety Culture Survey' in your hospital to evaluate the patient safety culture, it also guides you on
how to carry out the analysis with the help of Excel. Apart from this it provides PowerBI dashboard to showcase analysis of the survey.
Please note that I have followed the reference of AHRQ (Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality) for the survey.


For this project, I have used self created data and it does not belong to any healthcare organization
